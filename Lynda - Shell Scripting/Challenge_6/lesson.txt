This challenge was quite simple.
The only challenge I came across was the thread itself.
I had to change the timer to about 60 secounds, as it required me to identify
thread.

I have learned that, there is an easier way.
I could have used ./proc.sh TIME & 

This would only require me to use one terminal.
