# Purpose
This repository is to provide evidence that I am learning. At this current stage of time, I am currently working in a service Desk role. I have been scripting a lot more to troubleshoot my problem.

Also, I thought this would be helpful for me to add some of the commands to this repository, so I have an understanding of what I have learned using this command.

## Programming Languages
- Bash
- Powershell
- Rust
- Python
